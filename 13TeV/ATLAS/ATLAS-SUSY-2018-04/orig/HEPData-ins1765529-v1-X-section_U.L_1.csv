#: name: X-section U.L 1
#: description: The observed upper limits on the model cross-section in units of pb for simplified models with combined ${\tilde{\tau}}^{+}_{R,L} {\tilde{\tau}}^{-}_{R,L}$ production. Three points at ${M({\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{1})}=200GeV$ were removed from the plot but kept in the table because they overlapped with the plot's legend and are far from the exclusion contour.
