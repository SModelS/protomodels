!) find out why UL result is used, not comb result!

*) fix the float point pids issue xsecComputer.match
*) fix the K=nan issue

*) add also steps that shift N1,C1,N2 simultaneously
*) add also steps that shift the whole spectrum simultaneously
*) add also steps that increase/decrease mass and xsecs simultaneously
?) clean up likelihood scanner code
?) see if the Z scanner works
*) see if transitions between offshell region and onshell region work
?) make hiscore.hi a simple transparent cache for hiscores.dict
*) harmonize models in dict files and in pmodel.py files
*) ruler should use same particle namer as the rest
*) penalize for extreme signal strength multipliers

+) penalize if we are out-of-grid of one experiment
+) drop the "states"? maybe not yet!

.) adapt ruler
.) fix the movie maker (if it is broken)
.) do_combine needs to propagate
.) make sure model always gets same K,Z scores when rerunning
.) if C1 or N2 changes, have a small chance for the other to jump to same mass
.) when C1 or N2 unfreeze, have a certain chance for them to unfreeze to 
   offshell regime
.) introduce more detailed hiscores dictionaries
.) csetup should be in toplevel dir
.) upHi, clean up after uploading
.) forbidden particles, introduce monikers
.) forbidden particles, introduce monikers
.) allow to restrict particle set
.) see if teleportation still works
.) see if the likelihood scanner works
