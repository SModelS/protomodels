!) see if the teststatScanner works
!) penalize for flavor violation
!) penalize for extreme signal strength multipliers

*) add also steps that shift N1,C1,N2 simultaneously
*) add also steps that shift the whole spectrum simultaneously
*) add also steps that increase/decrease mass and xsecs simultaneously
*) unify the logging and printing facilities
?) clean up likelihood scanner code
*) see if transitions between offshell region and onshell region work
+) penalize if we are out-of-grid of one experiment:
   intermediate: we have combiner.penalizeForMissingResults
+) drop the "states"? maybe not yet!


.) adapt ruler
.) fix the movie maker (if it is broken)
.) do_combine needs to propagate
.) make sure model always gets same K,Z scores when rerunning
.) if C1 or N2 changes, have a small chance for the other to jump to same mass
.) when C1 or N2 unfreeze, have a certain chance for them to unfreeze to 
   offshell regime
.) introduce more detailed hiscores dictionaries
.) csetup should be in toplevel dir
.) upHi, clean up after uploading
.) forbidden particles, introduce monikers
.) forbidden particles, introduce monikers
.) allow to restrict particle set
.) see if teleportation still works
.) see if the likelihood scanner works
.) fix the float point pids issue xsecComputer.match
.) find out why UL result is used, not comb result, for atlas-susy-2018-41:
   answer: because it is only one signal region, so doesnt count as a combo
.) (1000023,1000024) and (-1000023,1000024) should have same ssm, count
   only once in penalty
.) fix the K=nan issue
.) harmonize models in dict files and in pmodel.py files
.) rename hiscore.hi to hiscores.cache
.) make hiscores.cache a simple transparent cache for hiscores.dict,
.) plotHiscore print also "item" for combined results
.) ruler should use same particle namer as the rest
.) check the nans of the prior when running the teststat scanner
