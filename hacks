*) we are currently penalizing for non-democratic flavors,
	 see tester/combiner.py:penaltyForUndemocraticFlavors

*) we are currently penalizing for extreme signal strength modifiers (ssms),
	 see tester/combiner.py:penaltyForExtremeSSMs

*) we are currently penalizing if one experiment is entirely missing 
   in the builder's list of predictions, 
   see tester/combiner.py:penaltyForMissingResults

*) no hack but the penalties all get multiplied with the prior in 
   tester/predictor.py:computeSignificance

*) when "unfreezing" (adding) an C1 or a N2 particle, there is a 10%
	 chance to unfreeze to the offshell region, see
	 builder/manipulator.py:unFreezeParticle

*) when changing the mass of a C1 or a N2, there is a 10% that the other particle
   (N2 or C1) gets changed to the same mass, see
   builder/manipulator.py:randomlyChangeMasses

*) squarks and gluinos have a minimum mass of 310 GeV, see
 	builder/manipulator.py "walledpids"
